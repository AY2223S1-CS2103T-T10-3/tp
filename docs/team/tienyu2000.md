## Project: Workbook

### Overview 

WorkBook (WB) is a desktop app for CS/tech students who are applying for internships to manage their internship applications, 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, WB can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
